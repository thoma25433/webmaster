                            <p>We take training very seriously here at Space Shuttle. You will go through various scenerios ranging from emergencies to teamwork. </p>
                            <p>As part of the training here at Star Shuttle, you will learn the basics of space travel, orbits, and effects of microgravity on the human body. You will learn about different emergency procedures to follow such as, equipment failure or medical emergencies.</p>
                            <p>Participants will go through various simulation trainings. In theses trainings you will use realistic simulations to prepare for tasks such as spacewalks, operating equipment, and living in a space environment. Physical fitness is a huge part of our training. Our Physical fitness training consists of resistance and cardiovascular exercise, as well as countermeasures to prevent muscle and bone loss in microgravity.</p>
