            <h2>Why we started Star Shuttle</h2> 
            <p>We started Star Shuttle because We saw that there was barely any companies that was primarly focused on space travel that is affordable and can be accessed by anyone regardless of their experience with space. We also saw there was a lack of companies that focused on astronaut training and space pilot training.</p>
            <h2>What are our Goals?</h2>
            <p>Our goals are to open a Star Shuttle launch site in every country. We also want to eventually make space travel with Star Shuttle free!</p>
